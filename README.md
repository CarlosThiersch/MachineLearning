Growing up as the only son of an Eletric Engineer made me learn to love technology and a good math test. Today, as a bachelor student of Computer Engineering in LATAM's best university - USP, I see data as the problem and the solution of most of our modern problems. AI and ML have the power to drive humanity further than any other tool has ever tried to do.
This is a repository with some of my data science projects, from the basics of ML to the edge of research in AI.
